# ImageScrapper with selenium

### This app scraps and downloads the required number of searched images from Google Images and save it into local folder.

### Why an Image scrapper is needed?
 while working on an Image classification project where I had to download multiple images of different type I came across this problem .So i thought why can't this be  automated . I came across other apps which will do the same task for me but that was not as i wanted .So I made my own.

It becomes very easy to download multiple images of same kind and it can be useful in various ways among the most useful use case will be **Image Calssification**.

## Here is how it looks .!!
